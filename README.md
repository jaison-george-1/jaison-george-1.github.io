The above project helps us understand the highly corelated relationship between sales (using the sales transactions table) and income (uses the customer table). 
This co-relation helps the company understand where their high-income and low-income customers reside in the US.
Further, we take this analysis and apply it to product fit at a geography level. Using the above 2 data-points we can help the marketing and product team to target and sell the right products in the right states in the correcet proportion.
The first page of the report shows the co-relation and the customer income buckets. The second page shows us the product and marketing intelligence.
